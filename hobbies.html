    <p>This page could probably have been a part of the about me page I made, but I could not think of any other pages I wanted to make. So I just made this one separate. When in high school, I had many hobbies, but now because of work and college, the amount of free time I have decreased and so has the number of hobbies I have kept up with.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies back in high school was reading. I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy novels, and very rarely I would read nonfiction. A couple of my favorite books were <i>The Last Kingdom</i> by Bernard Cornwell and <i>Red Rising</i> by Pierce Brown. It has been a while since I read those book series, but I remember really enjoying both of them. They are both fiction, but different kinds of fiction. <i>The Last Kingdom</i> is about a kid in 9th/10th century England who is captured and raised by a Danish warlord. <i>Red Rising</i> starts on Mars where the main character is a slave who goes through a bunch of surgeries and training to pretend to be a member of this higher class of humans so he can start to dismantle the class system. Recently I have not read anything, but if I find something that sounds interesting enough I might pick it up. I'm not much of a tv or movie watcher, so I dont really watch either of those often either.</p>
    <p>Another one of my hobbies is gaming, which I have kept up with. I spend the majority of my free time playing video games or trying to get friends together to play board games(which doesn't usually work out). I also watch youtube videos or streams of other people playing games as well. Recently I have been playing Dead by Daylight, Old School Runescape, League of Legends, and I am excited to play Payday 3 when it comes out. I like playing online games that have are more competitive, and if I don't feel like playing those games I usually lean towards MMOs. There are not many single player story based games that I have managed to get into recently. Another MMO I have been playing a bit recently is Final Fantasy XIV, but I do not play that game as much as the others. If I had to pick one game that is my main game right now it is definitely Dead by Daylight. </p>
