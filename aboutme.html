    <p>I am a student at K-State majoring in Integrated Computer Science. I do my classes online and work when I am not working on school related assignments. Right now I work in the bakery at a Dillons store, which is a pretty alright job. Except I do not know how to bake anything.</p>
    <p>At work I typically work early in the morning and I unload the pallets of frozen baked goods that come in. After unloading the pallets and sorting through everything I put out anything that can be put out without being baked first. Some things come in premade in packages and I just put that stuff out right away unless it is full on the tables/shelves. Then I put anything I did not put out into the freezer as I go through everything that was already in the freezer to make sure anything that needs to be put out gets put out. After all that I can help package what our bakers were baking and getting that stuff out. Sometimes I have to close the bakery, which mostly consists of packaging whatever was left from what was baked in the morning and then cleaning. </p>
